# Apriori-algorithm
to implement Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm in Python. The goal is to generate association rules from transactional data and analyze the relationships between different items.


Use the following function signature and complete the implementation based on the outlined steps:

from apyori import apriori
import pandas as pd
def market_basket_analysis(transactions, min_support, min_confidence, min_lift):
"""
Implement Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm.
Parameters:
transactions (list of lists): Each inner list represents a transaction containing items.
min_support (float): The minimum support threshold for the Apriori algorithm.
min_confidence (float): The minimum confidence threshold for association rules.
min_lift (float): The minimum lift threshold for association rules.
Returns:
DataFrame: A formatted table of association rules with Support, Confidence, and Lift.
"""
pass # Your implementation here

You should follow these steps in your implementation:
1. Read the transactional dataset into a suitable format (list of lists).
2. Use the apyori library to apply the Apriori algorithm with the given support,
confidence, and lift thresholds.
3. Extract and format the association rules.
4. Present the rules in a structured format showing:
○ Support
○ Confidence
○ Lift

Dataset for Testing Your Algorithm:
Use the provided dataset groceries_final.csv, or generate a sample dataset like:

transactions = [
['milk', 'bread', 'butter'],
['milk', 'diapers', 'beer', 'bread'],
['bread', 'butter', 'diapers'],
['milk', 'bread', 'butter', 'diapers']
]
Visualization Task:
● Plot a bar chart to show the top 10 most frequent items.
● Plot a bar chart to show the lift values of the top 5 association rules.
Note: Test and visualize your association rules to interpret their significance.
